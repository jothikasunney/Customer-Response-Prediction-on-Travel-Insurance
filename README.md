Customer Response Prediction on Travel Insurance using XgBoost Classifier

In this project,Predictive Analytics is used to develop a model that predicts whether a customer will buy the travel insurance or not. The paper will discuss the research and investigation of applicable techniques, model implementation, evaluation of the proposed model, quantitative results, and the business value of qualitative findings. XGBoost Classifier is selected as the suitable algorithm and it is implemented after proper Data cleaning, Feature Encoding, and Feature Engineering techniques. RandomSearchCV coupled with RepeatedStratifiedKFold cross-validation is applied for hyperparameter tuning. XGBoost classifier with the optimum parameters has an accuracy of 81.1%, F1 score of 71.6%, the precision of 82.5%, and recall of 63.2%. To improve recall value, threshold fitting techniques are used, which will help to identify potential customers.
